Project Data Analysis for B2B Retail: Customer Analytics Report

xyz.com is a B2B startup that sells various products to other businesses/companies. As a data-driven company, every decision making in xyz.com is always based on data. Each quarter xyz.com will hold a townhall where all or divisional representatives will gather to review the company's performance during the last quarter.

As a data analyst, I am asked to provide data and analysis about the condition of the company in the last month to be presented at the townhall.

The things that will be reviewed are:
  1. How is the current growth in sales?
  2. Is the number of customers xyz.com increasing?
  3. And how many of those customers have made transactions?
  4. What are the product categories that customers buy the most?
  5. How many customers remain actively transacting?

The tables used in this project are:
  Table orders_1 : Contains data related to sales transactions for quarter 1 period (Jan – Mar 2004)
  Table of Orders_2 : Contains data related to sales transactions for the 2nd quarter period (Apr – Jun 2004)
  Customer Table : Contains customer profile data that registers as customer xyz.com
